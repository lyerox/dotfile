# lyerox's dotfiles
These are all my dotfile of my favorite tools, just here to record.
## vim
The first editor that I love to use, once I have got custom of it, I just will never get rid of it, now no matter what kind of editor that I have to use, I would first find a vim-style plugin to surpport .Yeah, This is what vim to me.
## emacs
Well, at the beginning of time I didn't like the emacs especially when I got loved into the vim, but when I began to learn the Lisp language , I find emacs's power, what's more I just find the spacemacs, well This is what I just ever wantted editor. spacemacs = emacs + vim, and have good ecosystem to develop and use.
